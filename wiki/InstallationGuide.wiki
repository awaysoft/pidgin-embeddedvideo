We have tried to keep it as simple as possible. So here it is!

First of all, be sure that you have downloaded and installed [http://pidgin.im Pidgin] and [http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ Adobe Flash Player].

== Installation from source code ==

=== Requirements ===

You will need these packages to be installed before compiling the plugin on your machine:

  * pidgin-dev
  * libglib2.0-dev
  * libcurl3-dev
  * libwebkit-dev >= 1.1.12

On Ubuntu Karmic you may type the following in a terminal to install the dependencies...
{{{
sudo apt-get install pidgin-dev libglib2.0-dev libcurl3-dev libwebkit-dev
}}}

On other Ubuntu versions you may need the libwebkit-dev package which may not be already in the repositories. You will find it [https://launchpad.net/~webkit-team/+archive/ppa here]. This page will tell you how to install it on your machine in just a few steps:

  * Write in a terminal...
{{{
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 2D9A3C5B
sudo apt-get update
}}}
  * Open _System > Administration > Software Sources_.
  * Click on the _Third-Party Software_ tab.

  * Click on the _Add_ button.
  * Paste the line below and click on the _Add Source_ button.
{{{
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webkit-team/ppa/ubuntu YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION main
}}}
where {{{ YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION }}} is {{{ jaunty }}} for Jaunty (9.04), {{{ intrepid }}} for Intrepid (8.10) or {{{ hardy }}} for Hardy (8.04). Then click _Close_.
  * Open _System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager_, press the _Reload_ button to get the latest version of the libwebkit-dev package.

=== Compilation ===

Extract the archive you have downloaded. The compilation should be easy like...

{{{
./configure
make
make install
}}}

Restart Pidgin, activate Pidgin Embedded Video under the "Plugins" menu and have fun! ;)

As a side note, you can uninstall the plugin with...
{{{
make uninstall
}}}
